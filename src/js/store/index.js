// createStore takes a reducer as the first argument
// You may also pass an initial state to createStore, useful for server side rendering and state preloading, 
// but for now weâ€™re not interested in that.
// The most important concept to understand here is that the state in Redux comes from reducers.

// Redux itself is a small library (2KB) and the most important methods are just three:
// getState for reading the current state of the application
// dispatch for dispatching an action
// subscribe for listening to state changes

// The subscribe method accepts a callback that will fire whenever an action is dispatched. 
// Dispatching an action means notifying the store that we intend to change the state.

// Calling fetch from an action creator does not work. 
// That's because Redux is expecting objects as actions but we're trying to return a Promise. 
// With redux-thunk we can overcome the problem and return functions from action creators. 
// Inside that function we can call APIs, delay the dispatch of an action, and so on.

// this enables redux DEV TOOLS
